        Mark a new memory as superseding an old one.

        ⚠️ HUMAN-ONLY ACTION: Only call this when the user explicitly confirms
        that one memory supersedes another. The auto-classifier flags conflicts
        as "contradicts" — this tool is for resolving those conflicts when the
        user decides the newer memory should replace the older one.

        This is a convenience wrapper for the common pattern of:
        1. Creating a 'supersedes' edge from new -> old
        2. Archiving the old memory (optional but default)

        Use this when the user has confirmed that information has been
        updated/corrected and wants to make it clear which version is current.

        The old memory is archived by default but remains in the database
        (soft delete — recoverable). You can find superseded memories via
        memory_graph or memory_related.

        Args:
            new_memory_id: ID of the newer/updated memory (the current truth)
            old_memory_id: ID of the older/outdated memory (being replaced)
            archive_old: Whether to archive the old memory (default True)
            created_by: Instance ID that created this supersession

        Returns:
            Dict with edge ID and archive status
