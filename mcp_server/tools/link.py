        Create a relationship edge between two memories.

        Use this to build the knowledge graph by connecting related memories.
        The edge goes from source -> target (directional by default).

        STANDARD RELATIONSHIP TYPES:
        - relates_to: General association (often set bidirectional=True)
        - derived_from: This memory came from processing that one
        - contradicts: Memories make conflicting claims (usually bidirectional). Auto-classifier uses this for any detected conflict.
        - exemplifies: This is an example of that concept
        - refines: Adds detail/nuance to another memory
        - supersedes: Newer memory replaces older (use memory_supersede for convenience)
          ⚠️ HUMAN-ONLY: Never set supersedes automatically. The auto-classifier will
          flag conflicts as "contradicts" — only promote to "supersedes" when the user
          explicitly confirms that the newer memory replaces the older one.

        Custom types are allowed - use descriptive names like "caused_by", "leads_to", etc.

        Args:
            source_id: ID of the source memory
            target_id: ID of the target memory (edge points TO this)
            relation_type: Type of relationship (see above, or custom)
            strength: Edge weight 0.0-1.0 for weighted traversal (default 1.0)
            bidirectional: If True, edge works in both directions (default False)
            metadata: Optional extra data to store with the edge (JSON object)
            created_by: Instance ID creating this edge (e.g., "clawdbot", "desktop")

        Returns:
            Dict with edge ID and confirmation message
