        Store a new memory in the memory palace.

        PROACTIVE USE - STORE MEMORIES WITHOUT BEING ASKED:
        - When decisions are made, store them (type: design_decision)
        - When bugs are found and fixed, store the solution (type: solution, gotcha)
        - When user preferences are expressed, store them (type: preference)
        - When architectural choices are made, store them (type: architecture)
        - When blockers are encountered, store them (type: blocker)
        - When something works that was tricky, store it (type: workaround, solution)
        - The user shouldn't have to tell you to remember - that's why this system exists
        - If it would be useful in a future session, STORE IT NOW

        AUTO-LINKING (two tiers):
        - **Auto-linked** (>= 0.65 similarity): Edges created automatically with LLM-classified types.
          Returned in `links_created`.
        - **Suggested** (0.50–0.65 similarity): Surfaced for human review, no edges created.
          Returned in `suggested_links` — present these to the user if relevant.
        
        For explicit supersession or other typed relationships, use supersedes_id or memory_link.

        Args:
            instance_id: Which Claude instance is storing this (e.g., "desktop", "code", "web")
            memory_type: Type of memory (open-ended - use existing types or create new ones like: fact, preference, event, context, insight, relationship, architecture, gotcha, blocker, solution, workaround, design_decision)
            content: The actual memory content
            subject: What/who this memory is about (optional but recommended)
            keywords: List of keywords for searchability
            tags: Freeform organizational tags (separate from keywords)
            importance: 1-10, higher = more important (default 5)
            project: Project this memory belongs to (default "life" for non-project memories)
            source_type: How this memory was created (conversation, explicit, inferred, observation)
            source_context: Snippet of original context
            source_session_id: Link back to conversation session
            supersedes_id: If set, create a 'supersedes' edge to this memory and archive it. ⚠️ Only use when the user explicitly confirms supersession.
            auto_link: Override config to enable/disable similarity-based auto-linking (None = use config)

        Returns:
            Dict with id, subject, embedded status, links_created (auto edges), and
            suggested_links (sub-threshold candidates for human review)
