        Store a new memory in the memory palace.

        PROACTIVE USE - STORE MEMORIES WITHOUT BEING ASKED:
        - When decisions are made, store them (type: design_decision)
        - When bugs are found and fixed, store the solution (type: solution, gotcha)
        - When user preferences are expressed, store them (type: preference)
        - When architectural choices are made, store them (type: architecture)
        - When blockers are encountered, store them (type: blocker)
        - When something works that was tricky, store it (type: workaround, solution)
        - The user shouldn't have to tell you to remember - that's why this system exists
        - If it would be useful in a future session, STORE IT NOW

        Args:
            instance_id: Which Claude instance is storing this (e.g., "desktop", "code", "web")
            memory_type: Type of memory (open-ended - use existing types or create new ones like: fact, preference, event, context, insight, relationship, architecture, gotcha, blocker, solution, workaround, design_decision)
            content: The actual memory content
            subject: What/who this memory is about (optional but recommended)
            keywords: List of keywords for searchability
            tags: Freeform organizational tags (separate from keywords)
            importance: 1-10, higher = more important (default 5)
            project: Project this memory belongs to (default "life" for non-project memories)
            source_type: How this memory was created (conversation, explicit, inferred, observation)
            source_context: Snippet of original context
            source_session_id: Link back to conversation session
