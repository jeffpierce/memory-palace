# Claude Memory Palace

Persistent semantic memory for Claude instances. Store facts, decisions, insights, and context across conversations. Search by meaning, not just keywords.

## Features

- **Semantic Search** - Find memories by meaning using local embedding models
- **Memory Types** - Organize memories as facts, decisions, architecture, gotchas, solutions, and more
- **Transcript Reflection** - Automatically extract memories from conversation logs
- **Multi-Instance Support** - Share memories across Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and web
- **Local Processing** - All embeddings and extraction run locally via Ollama
- **MCP Integration** - Works natively with Claude Desktop's MCP protocol

## Installation

See [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for detailed installation instructions.

**Quick start:**

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/jeffpierce/memory-palace.git
cd memory-palace

# Install (choose one method)
pip install -e .                    # Editable install from pyproject.toml
# OR use the installer scripts:
# Windows: install.bat or install.ps1
# macOS/Linux: ./install.sh

# Run setup wizard (detects GPU, downloads models)
python -m setup.first_run
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Ollama (https://ollama.ai)
- NVIDIA GPU with 4GB+ VRAM (recommended)

## Model Selection

Claude Memory Palace automatically selects models based on your available VRAM:

| VRAM | Embedding | LLM | Quality |
|------|-----------|-----|---------|
| 4-6GB | nomic-embed-text | qwen2.5:7b | Good |
| 8-12GB | snowflake-arctic-embed | qwen3:8b | Better |
| 16GB+ | sfr-embedding-mistral | qwen3:14b | Best |

See [docs/models.md](docs/models.md) for detailed model information.

## Usage

Once configured with Claude Desktop, use natural language:

```
"Remember that the database migration requires downtime"
"What do we know about the API rate limits?"
"Reflect on this conversation and save important decisions"
```

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `memory_remember` | Store a new memory |
| `memory_recall` | Semantic search across memories (supports `synthesize` param) |
| `memory_forget` | Archive a memory |
| `memory_reflect` | Extract memories from transcripts |
| `memory_stats` | Memory system overview |
| `memory_get` | Retrieve memories by ID (supports `synthesize` param) |
| `memory_backfill_embeddings` | Generate embeddings for memories without them |
| `handoff_send` | Send message to another Claude instance |
| `handoff_get` | Check for messages from other instances |
| `handoff_mark_read` | Mark a handoff message as read |

Both `memory_recall` and `memory_get` support `synthesize=true/false` to control whether results are returned as raw objects or processed through the local LLM for natural language summaries.

## Configuration

Configuration is loaded from `~/.memory-palace/config.json` with environment variable overrides.

**Environment variables:**

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `MEMORY_PALACE_DATA_DIR` | Data directory | `~/.memory-palace` |
| `OLLAMA_HOST` | Ollama server URL | `http://localhost:11434` |
| `MEMORY_PALACE_EMBEDDING_MODEL` | Embedding model | Auto-detected |
| `MEMORY_PALACE_LLM_MODEL` | LLM for reflection | Auto-detected |
| `MEMORY_PALACE_INSTANCE_ID` | Default instance ID | `unknown` |

**Config file (`~/.memory-palace/config.json`):**

```json
{
  "ollama_url": "http://localhost:11434",
  "embedding_model": null,
  "llm_model": null,
  "db_path": "~/.memory-palace/memories.db",
  "instances": ["desktop", "code", "web"]
}
```
